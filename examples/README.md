## Learning Path

### 1. Start with Basic (15 minutes)
- Understand SDK initialization
- Learn basic API calls
- See simple error handling
- Get familiar with data structures

### 2. Move to Advanced (30 minutes)
- Master complex request building
- Learn data extraction patterns
- Understand production patterns
- Explore integration possibilities

### 3. Build Your Own
- Combine patterns from both examples
- Add your specific requirements
- Implement custom features
- Deploy to production

## Common Use Cases

### Flight Operations Centers
```go
// Use advanced example patterns for:
// - Real-time flight planning
// - Performance analysis
// - Fuel optimization
// - Route planning
```

### Training Applications
```go
// Use basic example for:
// - Learning flight planning
// - Understanding aircraft types
// - Simple demonstrations
```

### Integration Projects
```go
// Combine both examples for:
// - Custom flight planning tools
// - Analytics platforms
// - Mobile applications
// - Web services
```

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# For advanced example (required)
export SIMBRIEF_USER_ID=your_user_id_here

# Optional: Enable detailed logging
export SIMBRIEF_DEBUG=true
```

### Finding Your SimBrief User ID

1. Go to [SimBrief.com](https://simbrief.com)
2. Log in to your account
3. Navigate to Account Settings
4. Find your User ID in the account information section

### Alternative: Using the Web Interface

If you don't have a user ID, you can still:
- Use the basic example to explore aircraft types
- Generate flight plan URLs (they'll open in your browser)
- Test API connectivity and responses

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Set SIMBRIEF_USER_ID" | Get your user ID from SimBrief account settings |
| "No flight plans found" | Create a flight plan on SimBrief website first |
| "Network error" | Check internet connection and SimBrief status |
| "Import errors" | Run `go mod tidy` to install dependencies |

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging to diagnose issues:

```bash
export SIMBRIEF_DEBUG=true
go run main.go
```

This will show:
- HTTP requests and responses
- API endpoints being called
- Response parsing details
- Error details and stack traces

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs** with debug mode enabled
2. **Review the documentation** in the [docs/](../docs/) folder
3. **Examine the source code** in [pkg/](../pkg/) for implementation details
4. **Open an issue** on GitHub with debug output

## Next Steps

After exploring the examples:

1. **Read the Documentation**
   - [Main README](../README.md) - Complete SDK overview
   - [API Integration Guide](../docs/api-integration.md) - Best practices
   - [Flight Planning Guide](../docs/flight-planning.md) - Concepts and workflows

2. **Explore the Source Code**
   - [pkg/client/](../pkg/client/) - Client implementation
   - [pkg/types/](../pkg/types/) - Data structures and types

3. **Build Your Own Application**
   - Start with patterns from these examples
   - Add your specific requirements
   - Implement error handling and logging
   - Consider rate limiting and caching

4. **Contribute Back**
   - Found a bug? Open an issue
   - Have improvements? Submit a pull request
   - Need a feature? Let us know

## Example Progression

```
Basic Example
    ‚Üì
Learn fundamentals
    ‚Üì
Advanced Example  
    ‚Üì
Understand production patterns
    ‚Üì
Your Custom Application
```

Each example builds on concepts from the previous one, so we recommend starting with the basic example even if you're experienced with APIs.

## Performance Tips

- **Cache aircraft data** - Aircraft types don't change frequently
- **Implement retries** - Handle temporary network issues
- **Use appropriate timeouts** - Don't let requests hang indefinitely
- **Monitor rate limits** - Respect SimBrief's API usage policies
- **Log strategically** - Use debug mode for development, minimal logging for production

Happy flight planning! üõ´
